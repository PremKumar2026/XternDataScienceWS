I used Google Maps to find "food trucks in Indianapolis". From what I found, I chose 4 trucks for Saturday and 4 for Sunday. The idea was to have breakfast at one, lunch at the next, dinner at another, and maybe a late-night snack at the last one.

I used another tool, routes-and-directions API, to find the exact spots of the trucks. Then, I used a tool called folium to draw a map that shows how to go from one truck to another. It was a fun mix of tech and food planning!

The complete set of results is in Github repo. The final plans are saved as ex_#_day.csv, and you can find the maps labeled as day#_map.html. If you want to see the maps in action, just download the HTML files to your computer and open them with a web browser.
